Cross-lingual and monolingual dictionaries are the basis of machine translation. Multilingual embeddings are a promising area of natural language processing. They increase the data and increase the already existing dictionaries. This research explores methods and algorithms for building embeddings. The study is focused on comparing algorithms and identifying the method of building and learning embeddings.
